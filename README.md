## Build your own algorithm

Please find the json files within `battle-data` folder for spiral abyss battle records. They are randomly selected, feel free to use them and build your own ranking algorithm - or whatever you like.

Currently we provide 1,000 records, if you would like more, **please create an issue and upload your work/demo**

Have fun!

## A Node.js/Javascript engineer?

Congrats! If you make such an elegant ranking algorithm that eveybody likes, your work could be integrated with our website!

Please make a PR within the `ranking-algorithm` folder(make it a single file please). You'll also find an example there.
